Final Project Description


The application I created was a store front for my Fraternities merchandise. It incorporates user authentication and authorization in order to verify users have access to view certain pages such as the admin page, or do certain actions such as place orders. When logged in, users may also look at all previous orders they have placed (admin users can view all orders placed in the admin order-list page). Users view all products from the database on the catalog page and can view specific products when they click on a product. When users have selected a specific product by clicking on it from the catalog page, they are prompted with an image and the product's description, in addition to a form where they pick a color, size, and quantity to order. This form is where users can insert into the database. Most of the issues I encountered were simple PHP errors, and styling errors. For example I couldn't figure out a way to make an element that I added to the page via a PHP loop into a grid. I also couldn't find a way to make an input field type int within the CMSB builder, there were only text boxes or text fields.
